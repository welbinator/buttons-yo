Welcome to the dumbest thing you've ever seen

This is a JavaScript button library that allows you to style buttons using nothing but fake attributes right in the html button tag.

The fake attributes currently supported are as follows:

  bg              (background color)
  border          (border color)
  radius          (border radius)
  pad             (padding)
  color           (font color)
  thickness       (border thickness)
  url             (URL to be opened when button is clicked on)
  target          (determines target of URL to be opened on click)
  depress         (button depresses npx on mousedown)
  
  hbg             (background color; hover state)
  hborder         (border color; hover state)
  hradius         (border radius; hover state)
  hpad            (padding; hover state)
  hcolor          (font color; hover state)
  hthickness      (border thickness; hover state)
  
  abg             (background color; active state)
  aborder         (border color; active state)
  aradius         (border radius; active state)
  apad            (padding; active state)
  acolor          (font color; active state)
  athickness      (border thickness; active state)
  
  
**How it works**

Instead of using CSS to style your buttons, simply add the fake attributs listed above inside the button tag.

For instance, to give a button a background color of red, simply add bg="red" inside the button tag. For examples, visit https://welbinator.github.io/buttons-yo
